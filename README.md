⚙️ How It Works  

1. **Soil Moisture Simulation** – The system randomly increases/decreases soil moisture every 3 seconds.  
2. **Pump Control** –  
   - Manual: Toggle pump ON/OFF with a button.  
   - Auto: Pump automatically turns ON when moisture < 40% and OFF when ≥ 40%.  
3. **Weather Updates** – Weather conditions change every 10 seconds.  
4. **Farming Tips** – New irrigation tip appears every 6 seconds.  
5. **Real-Time Graphs** – Moisture level is plotted on a dynamic line chart.
